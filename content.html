        <h3>Using the weak or common images</h3>
        <p>
            Images are one of the important and eye-catching design elements on a website. I believe we all know that an
            image is worth a thousand words.

            The above statement is appropriate if your website images are meaningful, relevant, high quality and
            authentic.

            If you use the images that can be found on hundreds of other websites, then they may work negatively. Using
            the stock images undermine your credibility. Just say no to stock images.

            Make sure every image on your website is relevant, meaningful and of course high quality. They should serve
            a purpose like pushing the visitors toward the conversion goal.

        <h3>Not Updating The Site</h3>
        <p>
            Nobody likes a website that is boring and dull or one that seems like it has not been updated in 5 years.

            When the visitors come to a site that appears dated, they immediately think that this company does not keep
            up with modern times. Or, even bad, they may also think this company is no longer in business.

            Trust me, there are so many old websites still online but they are no longer in operation.

            When people come to an old looking website, most of them just click away as fast as possible and they will
            probably move on to your competitor’s site.

            As a general rule, I recommend people that they should consider updating or refreshing their websites in
            every 2 to 3 years.

        <h3>Unreadable Texts</h3>
        <p>As much as images and videos dominate the content, text still plays a major role in compelling people to stay on
        your website.

        In spite of knowing that some websites have the habit of putting up oddly shaped fonts that are very hard to
        read. If people can’t read your copy easily then how people will take your desired action.

        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>
            All great websites are designed to serve the customer better, so keep your website simple, easy and concise.
            That’s the thumb role for web design.

            Use this post as a checklist of website design mistakes to check if your website has any of the above
            mistakes. If so then it’s time to consider a new design.
