        <h3>Slow loading time</h3>
        <p>
            I will start this point with an interesting statistics. According to surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com,
            47% of the web users expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less and 40% of people abandon a website that
            takes more than 3 seconds to load.
            Just think about this, if your website loading time is more than 3 seconds then you are losing almost half
            of your visitors without even having a look to your website. Your website loading time must be less than 3
            seconds.
            Walmart Found for every 1 second of improvement in loading speed they experienced up to 2% increase in
            conversions.
        </p>
        <p>There are numerous reasons that can increase your website loading time. I will outline some of the common
            reasons here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using too many plugins</li>
            <li>Excessive use of flash</li>
            <li>Broken links</li>
            <li>Bad coding</li>
            <li>Images are too big in size</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many techniques, both from a design and coding aspect can be applied to your website for faster loading. Some
            of the techniques are given below-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t use too many plugins</li>
            <li>Optimize your images</li>
            <li>Reduce server response time</li>
            <li>Minimize HTTP Requests</li>
            <li>Reduce redirects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Not Having a Prominent Call to Action (CTA)</h3>
        <p>
            One of the must have elements in your website for conversion is the call to action button. No one is going
            to take action (e.g. sign-up for a mailing list, make a purchase, request a quote, or simply call you) if
            you don’t ask them to do so.

            You have to make it clear to your visitors what you want them to do. Lack of prominent call to action button
            on a website wastes chance of turning visitors into leads, subscribers and customers.

            Just take a look at the below screenshot and it has no clear CTA button. There is a weak one at the bottom
            but the color of the button and the background color is exactly same. Therefore, the CTA button can easily
            be overlooked by the visitors.<br>Here are the few things you need consider to craft a winning CTA-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your CTA button color must be contrasting</li>
            <li>The button text should explain what will happen after clicking</li>
            <li>You need to include the button in right place so that people can see that easily</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Too Many Plugins</h3>
        <p> Plugins help to introduce new features to the website. But, using too many plugins can increase your website
            loading time. I already have discussed the consequence of slow loading speed.

            Sometimes people try to use different plugins into their websites just because they can, not because they
            really need to have them.

            Make sure you don’t use any extraneous stuff unless you must need it and only use the plugins if they are
            really needed to make your site functional.</p>
